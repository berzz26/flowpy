Flowpy, a simple python script whcih uses the Graphviz library to create flowcharts of code.
Had a shitty assignment to submit all the practicals as flowcharts. so wrote this simple script, with the help of gpt.

How to use :

in the c_code variable, put the code you want to generate flow chart for, run the script (make sure you have graphviz installed, if not then run the command in your cmd, pip install graphviz)

once you run the script, you will be having the png of your flow chart in the same folder as your source code.

NOTE: this yet does not support all the functions of C, but it would work for basic loops, conditionals, and prinitng stuff.
